## About Me | Things Iâ€™ve missed during the pandemic

1) My family and friends. Some of my favorite people are on the east coast and some are much much closer (in Oregon), and I haven't felt safe seeing any of them. 

2) Going out to eat. I **love** going out to eat, though I've transitioned to take-out, which has it's perks. 

3) Events. I was super excited to move to Seattle to be in a place were events, like live podcast shows and concerts, actually happen. Well, they haven't been happening.
